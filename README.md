**Hacktoberfest**, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by **DigitalOcean**. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:

-   Prepare and share your project for collaboration
-   Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
-   Organize an event
-   Mentor others
-   Donate directly to open source projects

## Rules for Hacktoberfest
